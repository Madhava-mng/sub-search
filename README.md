# sub-search
subdomain searching , overwritten from m4dh4v45b1n

though [m4dh4v45b1n](https://github.com/Madhava-mng/m4dh4v45b1n) works nice on termux, It supports new verssion only and privilage require to execute the binary.

so i rewritten this script, It supports both new and old verssion of ruby without requirements of sdcd.
